# 1. Overview

This manual provides explanations based on the systems below. If the system used in the field is different from the ones described here, the worker on the site should refer to and use this manual according to the on-site system.

*   **System specifications described in the manual**

    Robot guns (for change of welding guns): A servo gun (G1), a servo gun (G2), an equalizerless gun (G3), and an equalizer-fitted gun (G4)

    Stationary guns: Servo gun (G5), servo gun (G6), and equalizerless gun (G7)

1.  Servo gun

    The servo gun is set as an additional axis of the robot. It is used in a way that the rotational force of the servo motor is transmitted to the ball screw to operate the gun tips, thereby controlling the squeezing and opening operations.
2.  Equalizer-fitted gun

     This is a spot welding gun that performs squeezing and opening motions using pneumatic pressure and is controlled by the welding condition output signal and welding (electrification) output signals, and is based on a method of mechanically performing the equalizing operation during welding.
3.  Equalizerless gun

    This is a spot welding gun that performs squeezing and opening motions using pneumatic pressure and is controlled by the welding condition output signal and welding (electrification) output signal, and is based on a method in which the equalizing operation is performed by the robot as the gun has no cylinder for the equalizing operation for the welding.
