# 2.2 Step 0. Pre-inspection

Pre-inspection is an item that must be performed in advance for the initial setting of the servo gun, and it is required to complete the following setting before entering main menus.

* **Additional axis parameter**
  * To input the motor and amp specifications, etc. of the motor of the servo gun that is to be used for the designated additional axis.
  * Soft limit can be set arbitrarily because it is changed during the initial setting procedure.
* **Setting of the tool number corresponding to the gun number**&#x20;
  * To designate the servo gun and gun number that you want to set now.
* **Tool data setting**
  * To input load estimation, tool angle/length, etc.
* **Servo gun parameter setting**
  * To set necessary items such as command value offset, squeezing force permissible error.

Pre-inspection is a step to check whether the pre-setting items have been completed. If they are not performed, you can move to the screen where you can perform relevant settings. You must complete the relevant settings before proceeding with the initial setting of the servo gun.
