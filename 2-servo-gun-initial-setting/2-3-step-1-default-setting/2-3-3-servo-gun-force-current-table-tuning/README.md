# 2.3.3 Servo gun squeezing force - current table tunning

To squeeze the various servo guns, which are to be installed to the robot, with the desired squeezing force, it is necessary to make the current supplied to the servo gun correspond to the generated squeezing force. For this, our company provides a servo gun squeezing force - current table. It is necessary to tune this table to match with the servo gun. The accuracy of this tuning determines the accuracy of the servo gun squeezing force. In consideratin of it, tuning must be performed before using the servo gun.

To use this function, it is necessary to select five representative values among the squeezing forces to be used. Tuning the servo gun squeezing force - current table is a process to find the currents that match with these five representative squeezing forces. This table can vary depending on the posture of the servo gun, so it is necessary to perform tuning for each case of when the direction of the moving electrode is in the gravity direction and in anti-gravity direction, and, through this method, squeezing can be performed with high accuracy in various postures of the servo gun.

Our company provide manual mode for the tuning of the servo gun squeezing force - current table.

*   Tuning in manual mode

    Tuning can be performed regardless of the communication with the squeezing force gauge, and the user can directly tune the table by inputting the measured squeezing force.
