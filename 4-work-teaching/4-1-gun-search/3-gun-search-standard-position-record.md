The consumption amount of an electrode is measured based on an unconsumed new tip. Therefore, the process of registering the reference position with a new tip is absolutely necessary at least once in the beginning, and this is called gun search reference position record.

>1. Set 『**2: Gun search reference position record**』 to <**Valid**>.
>2. Execute the created gun search program. In the spot monitoring screen, the state of the gun search will be initialized to “**Incomplete**”.
>3. Set 『**2: Gun search reference position record**』 to <**Invalid**>. After that, the amount of variation compared to the reference position will be calculated as a consumption amount by using the gun search program.
