# 4.1.4.2 Equalizerless gun

As an equalizerless gun only manages the consumption amount on the fixed electrode, so the gun search function here measures the fixed electrode consumption amount.

>1. Movement to the record position of the step occurs.
>2. The fixed electrode approaches at the search speed and switches the phototube contact signal.
>3.  When a signal is detected by the photo tube, the fixed electrode consumption amount is measured and the opening operation is executed.  
 >   **Fixed electrode consumption amount = sensor detection position - gun search record position**  
>4. When the opening is completed, the fixed electrode consumption amount is updated.
