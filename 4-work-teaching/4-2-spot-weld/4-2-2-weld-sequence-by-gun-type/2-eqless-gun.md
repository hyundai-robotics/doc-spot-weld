>1. At the N-1 step position, the fixed electrode moves to the position away from the record position as much as the ‘fixed electrode clearance.’
>2. With the robot equalizing operation, the fixed electrode moves to the recordd position of the step, and the pneumatic presssure makes the moving electrode squeeze the panel.
>3. When the squeezing force is matched, the welding execution signal is outputted together with the welding condition signal at the position.
>4. When the welding completion signal (WI) is inputted, the fixed electrode moves to the position away from the record position as much as the ‘fixed electrode clearance’ and the moving electrode moves to a position where pneumatic pressure is not supplied.
>5. Movement to the next step occurs.
