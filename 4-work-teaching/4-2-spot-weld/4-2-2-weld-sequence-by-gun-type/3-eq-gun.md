>1.At the N-1 step position, movement to the record position of the step occurs.
>2. The welding execution signal is outputted together with the welding condition signal. The equalizing facility makes the fixed electrode squeeze the panel and the pneumatic pressure makes the moving electrode squeeze the panel.

>4. Movement to the next step occurs.
