# 4.4.1 Panel thickness registration

When it comes to the servo gun opening position recording, the position of the moving electrode will be calculated by using the pre-designated panel thickness, so the panel thickness should be registered. There are two provided methods of registering the panel thickness. One is that the user inputs it manually and the other is that the panel thickness is automatically registered while the panel is squeezed.
