The recording of the spot welding step of the servo gun is usually performed according to the following procedure.

1. Check that the state is the one-touch record state. (\[GUN] key LED turned on.)
2. Contact the fixed electrode of the servo gun to the workpiece.
3. Squeeze the moving electrode to the workpiece by performing manual squeezing operation.
4. Press the \[**Record**] key to record the Spot statement together with the  step. -> Automatic registration of the panel thickness
5. Separate the moving electrode with a manual closing operation.
6. Movement to the next position occurs.

 Servo gun opening position recording is a procedure without the steps (3) and (5) above, making it possible to save a significant amount of time. For this, the controller should know the thickness of the panel to weld.
