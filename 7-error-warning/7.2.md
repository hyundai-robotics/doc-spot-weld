| :----------------------------------------------------: | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
|      <p>W0009 </p><p>Brake slip occurred</p><p>(the set value exceeded)</p>     | The brake slip measured during stud welding exceeded the brake deviation detection range set in the welding sequence.                  | Check the set brake deviation detection range, and, if necessary, change the value to a greater one.                                                               |
|       <p>W0105 </p><p>Electrode replacement required total consumption amount </p><p>exceeded</p>       | This warning occurs if the total consumption amount detected by gun search exceeded the electrode replacement required consumption amount (both of moving and fixed electrodes) set in the welding gun parameter.       | <ol><li>Check the set maximum electrode consumption amount.</li><li>Check whether the gun search reference position is registered normally.</li><li>Replace the electrode.</li></ol>        |
|      <p>W0106 </p><p>The moving electrode exceeded </p><p>the electrode replacement required consumption amount</p>      | This warning occurs if the moving electrode consumption amount detected by gun search exceeded the (moving) electrode replacement required consumption amount set in the welding gun parameter.             | <ol><li>Check the set (moving) electrode replacement required consumption amount. </li><li>Check whether the gun search reference position is registered normally.</li><li>Replace the electrode.</li></ol>   |
|      <p>W0107 </p><p>The fixed electrode exceeded </p><p>the electrode replacement required consumption amount</p>     | This warning occurs if the fixed electrode consumption amount detected by gun search exceeded the (fixed) electrode replacement required consumption amount set in the welding gun parameter.             | <ol><li>Check the set (fixed) electrode replacement required consumption amount. </li><li>Check whether the gun search reference position is registered normally.</li><li>Replace the electrode.</li></ol> |
| <p>W0108 </p><p>During the jog operation, </p><p>the actual squeezing force exceeded </p><p>the set value</p> | When squeezing is performed through manual operation of the axis, the actual squeezing force exceeds the set squeezing force. When this occurs, operate the servo gun axis in the opposite direction. | <ol><li>Check whether the squeezing force of the axis that will be operated is sufficiently set.</li><li>As a mechanical problem with the servo gun is anticipated, you need to contact the servo gun manufacturer for inquiry. </li></ol><p></p> |
|  <p>W0109 </p><p>Impossible to manually </p><p>operate the servo gun not </p><p>selected</p> | The servo gun you want to operate is different from the selected servo gun.                                             | When you select a servo gun, you need to perform manual jog operation. First, select the servo gun you want to operate with the R210 code and then perform the operation.                                          |
